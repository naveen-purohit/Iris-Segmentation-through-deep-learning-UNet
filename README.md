# U-Net Architecture
U-Net is a type of Convolution neural network  used for image segmentation. it contains encoder part for extracting low level features,decoder part for transforming low level features into high resolution images and skip connections to concatenate the low level features which high level.its architecture resembles to the letter U that is why it is called as U-net
